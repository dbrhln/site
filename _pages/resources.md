<a href="https://github.com/dbrhln/EXP-EXP-ONLINE-2020"><font size=4>Github Repository: Online Experiment</font></a>

This repository contains the relevant scripts for implementing the online version of the experiment for my PhD thesis on exploration and exploitation in multi-armed bandit problems and for hosting it on Google App Engine. The experiment is programmed using HTML and Javascript, and the json data file is parsed using R (tidyverse). The deployed experiment can be viewed <a href="https://exp-exp-289600.ts.r.appspot.com/">here</a>.

<a href="https://dbrhln.shinyapps.io/simulate-DDM/"><font size=4>Shiny Web App: Visualising The Diffusion Decision Model</font></a>

This web app illustrates how changing the drift, boundary, and start point parameters in the standard diffusion decision model affects choice probabilities and response time distributions. The R code for the
web app can be found <a href="https://github.com/dbrhln/simulate-DDM">here</a>.
