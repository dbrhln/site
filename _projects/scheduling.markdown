Scheduling theory describes the optimal policies used to determine the allocation of resources to various tasks and the order in which tasks should be completed subject to a deadline. Our research investigates how people utilise information on difficulty, reward, and deadline to schedule tasks, whether people are able to adopt optimal scheduling policies, and if task complexity (e.g., the number of tasks that need to be fit into the schedule) affects the ability to adopt optimal policies.
